# What I think about when I talk about my job

One of my earliest childhood memories was creating a kindergarten project on the topic of "What I want to be when I grow up". Sitting at our kitchen table over a colorful piece of paper with the help from my father I listed the following occupations:



* an astronaut
* a rally driver
* a football goalkeeper

Even though I showed ambition in the early years I never got near fulfilling any of those wishes. Serbia's space program is non-existing, and my driving skills barely get me through day-to-day rides around Belgrade. At least I drive a rally car (it's a Toyota Yaris, unfortunately not the GR one). When it comes to football I made it to my high-school class team based only on the fact that I fulfilled the following requirements:


* are you a boy - **YES**
* are there more than 5 boys in your class so that there's an actual competition for the gollie spot - **NO**

My goalkeeping episode finished gloriously in the high-school tournament semi final, after saving two penalties but sadly that wasn't enough.

25 years after that kindergarten assignment I find myself looking at the same colorful piece of paper again. Except the piece of paper is now a dark-themed page of my text editor. But the question is the same "What I want to be ~~when I grow up~~".

I studied English language and literature in college. I have loved the English language since I was a five-year-old kid. I never wanted to be a teacher so I opted for the dreaded career of being a Customer Service Agent.


## Transition to technical writing

I started my technical writing career almost by accident. The company where I worked as a customer service agent had a job opening for a technical writer role (for the same product). I applied for it, passed the interview and got the job. Easy as that. At that time I wasn't fully aware what this job was all about. I was too focused on writing the perfect sentences, spending hours reviewing every single article just to avoid embarrassing myself.


## Technical writing after five years

Five years is a lot of time and things can change during that period. For me, the thing that has changed (in the professional aspect at least) is how I perceive my work. I've started to dislike it. And not just "oh I hate Mondays" kind of hate. I started hating everything related to my job and career. I hated waiting for people to review my documents, the neglect of documentation, deadlines, everything.

This year I lost my job due to the "global financial climate" or however you want to wrap it. I was desperate, and at some point even considered changing my career. But in the end I found another technical writing job and just started thinking about it as a 9 to 5 obligation that helps pay my bills.

Do I enjoy working with my colleagues and being a part of the team?

Yes, definitely. I'm lucky enough to be surrounded with great colleagues who accepted me from the first day.

Do I enjoy writing documentation?

On a good day, yes. But those days are scarce and I cherish them. But I learned not to perceive myself as a technical writer. I believe I'm more than the person who sits at the laptop and _"Develops comprehensive documentation and translates complex ideas into easily understandable text"_ or whatever is the newest trend in writing the job description. At least this job gives me an opportunity to learn about new technologies and leaves me enough time to explore my hobbies.

In the end I didn't become what I wanted to be. At least career-wise. But I try to explore new possibilities every now and then. Whether that is photography, cooking, writing (the creative kind) or any other activity that keeps me sane, occupied and fulfilled.
