# What I think about when I talk about my job

One of my earliest childhood memories was creating a kindergarten project on the topic of "What I want to be when I grow up". Sitting at our kitchen table over a colorful piece of paper with the help from my father I listed the following occupations:

- an astronaut
- a rally driver 
- a football goalkeeper

Even though I showed ambition in the early years I never got near fulfilling any of those wishes. Serbia's space program is inexisting, and my driving skills barely get me through my weekly drives through Belgrade. At least I drive a rally car (it's a Toyota Yaris, unfortunately not the GR one). When it comes to football I made it to my high-school class team based only on the fact that I fulfilled the following requirements:

- are you a boy - YES
- are there more than 5 boys in your class so that there's an actual competition for the gollie spot - NO

My goalkeeping episode finished gloriously in the high-school tournament semi final, after saving two penalties but sadly that wasn't enough.

25 years after that kindergarten assignment I find myself looking at the same colorful piece of paper again. Expect the piece of paper is now a dark-themed page of my text editor. But the questions is the same "What I want to be ~~when I grow up~~".

I studied Enlgish language and literature in college. I loved english language since I was five-year-old. I never wanted to be a teacher so I opted for the dreaded career of being a Customer Service Agent. 

## Technical writing

I started my technical writing career almost accidentally. The company where I worked as a customer service agent had a job opening for a techcnial writer role (for the same product). I applied for it, passed the interview and got the job. Easy as that. At that time I wasn't fully aware what this job was all about. 
I was too much focused on writing the perfect sentences, spending hours reviewing every single article just to avoid embarrassing myself. 

## Technical writing after five years

Five years is a lot of time. It's an entire Olympics ____ and many things can change during that time. For me, the thing that change (in the professional aspect at least) is the view of my work. I started disliking it. And not just "oh I hate Mondays" type of hate. I started hating everything related to my job and career.
