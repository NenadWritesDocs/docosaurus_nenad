# Nenad Pajović, Technical Writer - CV

## About me

Technical writer with 7+ years of experience designing and maintaining documentation for engineering-heavy products, with a strong focus on docs-as-code workflow and automation. 

Over time, my work has shifted from producing individual documents toward building documentation systems that reduce manual effort, enforce consistency, and minimize subjective review cycles. I enjoy working close to engineering teams, using Git-based workflows, scripting, and AI-assisted tooling to improve documentation quality at scale.

Background in language and writing, with a practical, systems-oriented approach to documentation and developer enablement.

Can talk for hours about coffee, bicycles, and cooking. Enjoying photography, bicycle maintenance, farmer markets and reading. Always learning.

If needed, can provide reference letters for my previous job positions. You can  download a more formal version of my CV as a PDF file [⬇ Download my CV](/NenadPajovicCV.pdf).
